Dragon ball Z Quiz is an Angular app that provides you multiple choices, each choice may score you one or multiple virtue points as below:

* Bravery: how likely you will try to solve problems with your fists, be your reasons good or evil;
* Friendly: how likely you will try to solve problems by first showing empathy to the other side;
* Rational: how likely you will try to think in a practical solution for everybody;
* Cowardly: how likely you will just run away or take advantage of the situation;
* Dreadful: how likely you will solve problems through evil deeds;

The final score will rank you with characters of Dragon Ball Z based on similarity on your virtues.
